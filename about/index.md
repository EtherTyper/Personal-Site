Hi, I'm Harlan Haskins. 

I'm an 18 year old software developer in Rochester, New York.

I attend [RIT](http://www.rit.edu), where I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I'm a member of [Computer Science House](http://csh.rit.edu).

I primarily write for iOS, but I've been known to dabble in Python, C, and Java.

You can find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/harlanhaskins) and on [GitHub](http://github.com/harlanhaskins).
