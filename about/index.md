Hi, I'm Harlan Haskins, and I'm a software developer in Rochester, New York.

I primarily write in Objective-C for iOS, but I've been known to dabble in Python, C, and Java.

I attend [RIT](http://www.rit.edu), where I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I'm a member of [Computer Science House](http://csh.rit.edu).

You can find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/harlanhaskins) and on [GitHub](http://github.com/harlanhaskins). My Resume is available [here.]({{ site.baseurl }}/Resume.pdf)
